Hey, let's have this said before anything. Thank YOU, for downloading my pack. Really. Tipping my hat to you. Right now. There we go, my hat is tipped.



- [Introduction:] -

Feeling needy to punish anyone, or perhaps yourself? The Doom Room got you covered! 
But lo and behold, no high expectations or hidden content here. This package is
simply the map itself and the configuring text file. The map itself showcases a
successful test of mine exercising a timed boulder mechanism. Boulder traps roll out 
of bounds for the player as they trigger a chain reaction of boulder traps. Each
mechanism tick shows the time left using the bust wall event on a set of 8 pillars
whose color reflect the urgency. At the last tick, doom ensues and the player together
with whatever else was in the room, gets steamrolled. Have a go with the editor to see
how it's built. Also feel free to come with criticism on it's structure. Have fun!



This package will be shared and updated via Github and will be the main way of 
finding it. This is to avoid redundancy for the viewers. Again, thanks a million 
for simply taking your time to even READ this and if you see anything that's looking 
like a bug or something that could need fixing, please feel free to report them 
on our Discord Server in the proper channel!


Speaking of redundancy, lemme introduce our Discord Channel again! 's great! 
You should really head on over!
