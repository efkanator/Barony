# Barony
All modded stuff that I both have made and have in plan for my custom version of Barony, available on Steam.

This entitles my custom:
- models
- items
- stages
- language files


I do not own Barony. As mentioned it is available on Stean from their proper publisher, Turning Wheel LLC, and I claim nothing as partially my own 'cept for my custom designs. Please support the official release.
