Hey, let's have this said before anything. Thank YOU, for downloading my map pack. Really.

- [Introduction:] -

SfT is a very cave-centric map-pack containing the travels through escalating difficulty
with the following themes: 

	cave, mountain interior so-to-say, ranging from tight spaces to wide corridors with 
	hidden stashes and chasm floors
	(CAVE, using attribute MINES), 

	forestry, with meadows and scattered sheds. I am well aware that there's no open sky and 
	that the forest has an underground appearance but we've all got imagenation so let's
	put it to use, huh?
	(FOREST, using attribute SWAMP), 

	ancient, being extremely resembling to the original Labyrinth but I'll find a way yet
	to make it stand out
	(ANCIENT, using attribute LABYRINTH),

	temple, serving as a sort of temple ground for cultist. Sure I would have
	it that way but let's use the attribute and keep it to magic traps, gnomes and trolls
	for now
	(TEMPLE, using attribute RUINS),

	chasm, serving as the pack's Cave 2.0 in terms of difficulty and challenge. It has a 
        throwback to the first 	the first stage type's cave textures with badder enemies as well 
	as increasing resemblance towards a hellish area
	(CHASM, using attribute UNDERWORLD)

	and lastly: lair, a hell-like cave area strongly resembling the original hell stages
        except for more interior portions than outside
	(LAIR, using attribute HELL)


The pack will be shared and updated via Github and will be the main way of finding. This 
is to avoid redundancy for the viewers. Again, thanks a million for testing the Map, if 
you see anything that's looking like a bug, please feel free to report them on our Discord 
Server in the proper channel! Also make sure to stay in touch with the folder's changelog.txt
file to not miss anything new!

- [Install:] -

	To install the Dungeon all you have to do is to copy the .lmp-files from the "maps" folder from the 
        ZIP into your "...steamapps/common/Barony/maps" folder. You should also replace the following lines
        at the top of your existing "levels.txt" resp. "secretlevels.txt", both also found in your
	"...steamapps/common/Barony/maps" folder, with these lines:
        
	levels.txt:
        map: sft_customstart
	
	secretlevels:
	map: sft_customstart

        Of course this method will be temporary until more maps are added. But after that ordeal you should
	be ready to go!

	
- [Uninstall:] -

	To uninstall the Dungeonsystem, go to your "...steamapps/common/Barony/maps" folder 
        and delete all files with the prefix "sft_". After you've done that, delete the 
        "levels.txt" and "secretlevels.txt"-
	
	Now right click on Barony in your Steam Library:
	> Settings
	> Local Data
	There you will see a button called "Verify Game Cache" click on that and wait for 
        Steam to check your Data. After around 1 minute at most, you'll be ready to play again.
	

	- [Simpler Solution] -
	
	If you dont care about the files in your folder but still want to play the usual setup:
	
	Copy the following Text into your "levels.txt" and the second one into your "secretlevels.txt"
	which you can found in your "...steamapps/common/Barony/maps" folder.
