Hey, let's have this said before anything. Thank YOU, for downloading my map pack. Really.



- [Introduction:] -

SFT started out as a very cave-centric map-pack containing the travels through escalating difficulty
as one would expect. Now it has turned much more oriented around mazes and non-linear structure.
More tight areas where you really have to squeeze around to find that ladder to the next level
Speaking of levels, the pack contains the following stages with the following themes: 


        Name:                    Cave
        Map-Attribute:           Mines
        IsImplemented:           Yes
        Quantity of Generations: 4
        Quantity of Modules:     12
        Secret Stages:           0
        Has boss stage:          Yes 
        Discription:             Mountain interior so-to-say, ranging from tight spaces to wide 
                                 corridors with hidden stashes and chasm floors. But these 
                                 stashes aren't just for take. Some say goblins have seeken out 
                                 refuge there and hoards their treasures from anyone uninvited.


        Name:                    Forest
        Map-Attribute:           Swamp
        IsImplemented:           Yes
        Quantity of Generations: 4
        Quantity of Modules:     5
        Secret Stages:           0
        Has boss stage:          Yes 
        Discription:             Forestry, with meadows and scattered sheds. I am well aware 
                                 that there's no open sky and that the forest has an 
                                 underground appearance but we've all got imaginations so let's 
                                 put them to use, huh? A bit more open than the cave predecessor 
                                 but ranges between wide and tight, to and fro nonetheless.


        Name:                    Ancient
        Map-Attribute:           Labyrinth
        IsImplemented:           No
        Quantity of Generations: 0
        Quantity of Modules:     0
        Secret Stages:           0
        Has boss stage:          No 
        Discription:             Ancient, being extremely resembling to the original Labyrinth 
                                 but I'll find a way yet to make it stand out.
        

        Name:                    Temple
        Map-Attribute:           Ruins
        IsImplemented:           No
        Quantity of Generations: 0
        Quantity of Modules:     0
        Secret Stages:           0
        Has boss stage:          No 
        Discription:             temple, serving as a sort of temple ground for cultist. Sure I 
                                 would have it that way but let's use the attribute and keep it 
                                 to magic traps, gnomes and trolls for now. It's gonna be a 
                                 purple Ancient. And, uh. Harder.


        Name:                    Chasm
        Map-Attribute:           Underworld
        IsImplemented:           No
        Quantity of Generations: 0
        Quantity of Modules:     0
        Secret Stages:           0
        Has boss stage:          No 
        Discription:             chasm, serving as the pack's Cave 2.0 in terms of difficulty and 
                                 challenge. It has a throwback to the first the first stage type's 
                                 cave textures with badder enemies as well as increasing 
                                 resemblance towards a hellish area.


        Name:                    Lair
        Map-Attribute:           Hell
        IsImplemented:           No
        Quantity of Generations: 0
        Quantity of Modules:     0
        Secret Stages:           0
        Has boss stage:          No 
        Discription:             And lastly: lair, a hell-like cave area strongly resembling the 
                                 original hell stages except for more interior portions than outside.
                                 Gonna have to work around the fact that demons enjoy smashing blocks
                                 in their way.

- [Install:] -

	To install the Dungeon all you have to do is to copy the "maps" folder from the 
        ZIP into your "...steamapps/common/Barony" folder and you are ready to go! But 
        make a backup for your existing "levels.txt" and "secretlevels.txt" first to not 
        risk losing your previous files.

	
- [Uninstall:] -

	To uninstall the Dungeonsystem, go to your "...steamapps/common/Barony/maps" folder 
        and delete all files with the prefix "SFT_". After you've done that, delete the 
        "levels.txt" and "secretlevels.txt"-
	
	Now right click on Barony in your Steam Library:
	> Settings
	> Local Data
	There you will see a button called "Verify Game Cache" click on that and wait for 
        Steam to check your Data. After around 1 minute at most, you'll be ready to play again.
	

	- [Simpler Solution] -
	
	If you dont care about the files in your folder but still want to play the usual setup:
	
	Copy the following Text into your "levels.txt" and the second one into your "secretlevels.txt"
	which you can found in your "...steamapps/common/Barony/maps" folder.
