I didn't feel secure enought to release the genmaps and modules for the cave and forest stages during the
initial update and narrowed the shared content down to just the starter map. But 'lo and behold, he comes
a roughly 80% complete cave genmap with 12 modules together with a roughly 50% complete forest genmap with
considerably less modules, 5. But unlike the original mappack, there weren't a boss stage at the end of
each stage but a mere transition stage where you would wander from one biome to the next. Well, this pack
will put the difficulty of all four generations of each stage and concentrate it into a single boss stage.

The secret modules for both the cave and forest stages works fine but there aren't currently any proper
secret stages although I have some in mind. Therefore, when you notice a puzzle leading to a somewhat
more secret gate/door leading to a secret stair case, just ignore them and try to enjoy the rest of this
update.

Right, this is the initial update for the pack and as of such, there is currently only one map available, 
the start map which is half adventurous and the other half a hub of sorts. Rest assured, quantitiy-wise it 
is not the only map that is in the making. I have a fairly concluded version of both the first two levels, 
being Cave and Forest.

For now, to avoid a barren taste for the pack, try changing the original "levels.txt" on the line that 
determines the game's start level. You can try and change "start" to "sft_customstart" and you're all set 
to go. This way, you can try the game with my additional map and not just the map on it's own. That 
wouldn't be any fun. At all.
