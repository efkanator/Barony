Right, this is the initial update for the pack and as of such, there is currently only one map available, the start map which is half adventurous and the other half a hub of sorts. Rest assured, quantitiy-wise it is not the only map that is in the making. I have a fairly concluded version of both the first two levels, being Cave and Forest.

For now, to avoid a barren taste for the pack, try changing the original "levels.txt" on the line that determines the game's start level. You can try and change "start" to "sft_customstart" and you're all set to go. This way, you can try the game with my additional map and not just the map on it's own. That wouldn't be any fun. At all.
