- 2017-08-18 - [0.0.6:] - Sands, More Forest and even more Sands - 

Added the new level area, sand, where you're put in a sandy ruin area filled with traps, traps and more
traps. I mean, yikes, this is the most perilous stage so far BY far, so make sure your GUARD is on guard.
Aside from the new stage, there was a distinct quantity of secret stages missing. Sure there were a stage-
specific boss stage for the cave so far but no secret stages such as the temple, the minetown and the 
gnome mine. So I added a little piece for the cave that it available as of now. But as the sands area is
filled with traps, that means that, to do yourself a favor, me a favor, sweet Jebus in the sky a favor,
please turn off the auto-generated traps flag in the main menu. This would trigger and ruin traps and such
of the maps themselves making them feel broken.

Now that I've mentioned the forest, it also felt lacking with it's low module quantity of 4. So there's that
fixed too. It's been upgraded up to 8 now so you can frolick to your heart's content.

What is left to be desired by me that I couldn't complete for this update would be secret/boss stages for
both the forest and the sand stage. I've rigged the levels.txt to skip these areas so once you've completed
SFTsand.lmp four times, you've hit bedrock and I haven't made anything past that. If you look through
every including map you'll find additional unfinished tests and secrets that might just see the light
of day. One day. Some day. Maybe. Mayday. We're going down.

EDIT: So, uh, the SFTforestboss.lmp completely slipped my mind in this new update and I had it misplaced
in the levels.txt file, as I claimed it wasn't finished. But it was. So, uh... There's that fixed. 
Sorry 'bout that.


- 2017-06-19 - [0.0.5:] - Here comes Caves and Forests - 

I didn't feel secure enought to release the genmaps and modules for the cave and forest stages during the
initial update and narrowed the shared content down to just the starter map. But 'lo and behold, he comes
a roughly 80% complete cave genmap with 12 modules together with a roughly 50% complete forest genmap with
considerably less modules, 5. But unlike the original mappack, there weren't a boss stage at the end of
each stage but a mere transition stage where you would wander from one biome to the next. Well, this pack
will put the difficulty of all four generations of each stage and concentrate it into a single boss stage.

The secret modules for both the cave and forest stages works fine but there aren't currently any proper
secret stages although I have some in mind. Therefore, when you notice a puzzle leading to a somewhat
more secret gate/door leading to a secret stair case, just ignore them and try to enjoy the rest of this
update.


- 2017-06-06 - [0.0.1:] - Initial Update - 

Right, this is the initial update for the pack and as of such, there is currently only one map available, 
the start map which is half adventurous and the other half a hub of sorts. Rest assured, quantitiy-wise it 
is not the only map that is in the making. I have a fairly concluded version of both the first two levels, 
being Cave and Forest.

For now, to avoid a barren taste for the pack, try changing the original "levels.txt" on the line that 
determines the game's start level. You can try and change "start" to "sft_customstart" and you're all set 
to go. This way, you can try the game with my additional map and not just the map on it's own. That 
wouldn't be any fun. At all.
