THINGS TO ADD:
- Complete the new Temple stage.
- Maybe not in this update but a final boss stage with a (non canon) Baron who puts the player through a gauntlet of sections from previous stages or at least with a strong sense of them, making the player have to go through a cave, forest, sand, temple and the final themed sections before they can challenge the Baron.

- 2017-09-05 - [0.0.7:] - The Sub-Complete Trio and the Temple Teaser - 

A pretty big update revamping most already added content as well as adding new submaps/modules. But
what I am proud to present in this release is the Sand Stage Secret which were delayed. It is done
and it's glorious. Shop modules are now available. There are four shop submaps just like vanilla each
with a theme resembling one of my stages albeit a bit inconsistent when it comes to whether they appear
in order of stage. The first three stages: cave, forest and sand should be at least 80% playable now
having their own boss stage, a secret stage and at least 8 submaps/modules each. Also, From now on I 
will post a list of changes at the bottom of each new update to show what's new as well as show what I 
intended to add/what I felt was missing the most.

On another note, I've added JUST about a teaser of the next stage, the Temple, using the Ruins map
attribute. Barely anything yet, just the entrance, base map and one submap.

CHANGES:
- forestboss: Changed structure of end phase.
- forestsecret1_maze: Added.
- forestsecret2_cultritual: Added.
- swampsecret: Changed textures to allow trees to replace some moss brick walls.
- customstart: Changed floor/ceiling texture in ogre vault section.
- secretlevels: Added ID# to every secret map for each stage from here on, for to better sort them
and updated secretlevels.txt accordingly.
- swampsecret: Added. Name remains vanilla since it's not customizable.
- sand01: Moved some wiring as well as added lever gate to the entrance.
- sand02: Added lever gate entrance.
- sand07: Changed two trapped gold piles into item piles.
- sand08: Changed the reward chest at the end of the course from food/food to treasure/magic. I also
added wiring to the entrance doors so they would activate each other at the same time if one were
primed.
- sand09: Added spike trap to cover the entire center of the module.
- sand10: Added.
- sand11: Added.
- sandboss: Added.
- labyrinthsecret: Added.
- Sand Stage Secret: Added. Difference between this one and the one above being that the above is the
entrance with questionable ability to have it's name changed so it stays the same as vanilla. The Sand
Stage Secret being the secret map the player is taken to from the entrance. Since that one is more
customizable I can name it something more fitting.
- Added dud chests to every entrance room for enhanced inventory management in MP.
- cave: Optimized base map for a new more open feel with higher ceiling in general.
- cave04: Made the module more connectable giving it entrance points from 4 directions instead of 2.
- cave11: Made the module also more connectable by replacing the corridor corner with 
a pit with small bridges.
- cave12: Added. An alternate version of cave11.
- cavesecret1_chestgallery: Revamped room 7 so the player wouldn't instantly be assaulted by zombies upon
triggering the trap. I also reworked the room 8 penalty by moving the hostile one closer upon spawning.
There is also additional dud chests added for an increased chance to get throwing rocks.
- practice: Removed and replaced with test.lmp after an overwrite error.
- shop00-03: Added.
- temple: Added.
- temple00: Added.
- Temple01: Added.
- Shop modules were reconfigured after the stock ones into stage based versions. Although stage 
relativity can differ amongst the shop modules encountered in different stages, testing shows this to 
be just a minor issue.
- secretlevels: Implemented (hopefully) functional and properly.


THINGS TO ADD:
- Shop modules. DONE.
- Sand stage boss. DONE.
- Sand stage secret. DONE.
- Sand stage secret entrace. DONE.


- 2017-08-18 - [0.0.6:] - Sands, More Forest and even more Sands - 

Added the new level area, sand, where you're put in a sandy ruin area filled with traps, traps and more
traps. I mean, yikes, this is the most perilous stage so far BY far, so make sure your GUARD is on guard.
Aside from the new stage, there was a distinct quantity of secret stages missing. Sure there were a stage-
specific boss stage for the cave so far but no secret stages such as the temple, the minetown and the 
gnome mine. So I added a little piece for the cave that it available as of now. But as the sands area is
filled with traps, that means that, to do yourself a favor, me a favor, sweet Jebus in the sky a favor,
please turn off the auto-generated traps flag in the main menu. This would trigger and ruin traps and such
of the maps themselves making them feel broken.

Now that I've mentioned the forest, it also felt lacking with it's low module quantity of 4. So there's that
fixed too. It's been upgraded up to 8 now so you can frolick to your heart's content.

What is left to be desired by me that I couldn't complete for this update would be secret/boss stages for
both the forest and the sand stage. I've rigged the levels.txt to skip these areas so once you've completed
SFTsand.lmp four times, you've hit bedrock and I haven't made anything past that. If you look through
every including map you'll find additional unfinished tests and secrets that might just see the light
of day. One day. Some day. Maybe. Mayday. We're going down.

EDIT: So, uh, the SFTforestboss.lmp completely slipped my mind in this new update and I had it misplaced
in the levels.txt file, as I claimed it wasn't finished. But it was. So, uh... There's that fixed. 
Sorry 'bout that.


- 2017-06-19 - [0.0.5:] - Here comes Caves and Forests - 

I didn't feel secure enought to release the genmaps and modules for the cave and forest stages during the
initial update and narrowed the shared content down to just the starter map. But 'lo and behold, he comes
a roughly 80% complete cave genmap with 12 modules together with a roughly 50% complete forest genmap with
considerably less modules, 5. But unlike the original mappack, there weren't a boss stage at the end of
each stage but a mere transition stage where you would wander from one biome to the next. Well, this pack
will put the difficulty of all four generations of each stage and concentrate it into a single boss stage.

The secret modules for both the cave and forest stages works fine but there aren't currently any proper
secret stages although I have some in mind. Therefore, when you notice a puzzle leading to a somewhat
more secret gate/door leading to a secret stair case, just ignore them and try to enjoy the rest of this
update.


- 2017-06-06 - [0.0.1:] - Initial Update - 

Right, this is the initial update for the pack and as of such, there is currently only one map available, 
the start map which is half adventurous and the other half a hub of sorts. Rest assured, quantitiy-wise it 
is not the only map that is in the making. I have a fairly concluded version of both the first two levels, 
being Cave and Forest.

For now, to avoid a barren taste for the pack, try changing the original "levels.txt" on the line that 
determines the game's start level. You can try and change "start" to "sft_customstart" and you're all set 
to go. This way, you can try the game with my additional map and not just the map on it's own. That 
wouldn't be any fun. At all.
