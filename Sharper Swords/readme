- [Introduction:] -

Barony has it's own assortment of four swords available in-game (so far). These 
consists of the bronze sword that, imo, looks more like a dagger. Then the iron 
sword potraying a scimitar cutlass but those don't have the sword feel I'm 
looking for in a slashing weapon. After that it's the steel sword looking much 
like the elven sword of  ID Software's Orcs & Elves, so that's one sword I can 
dig so far. At last, the magic sword, de-eerwin. Derwin. Der-Dar. Darwi. Darwin? 
Darwin. Darwin the sword which' appearance leaves more to be desired from me.

This is the part where's I'm supposed to go "Pfft, those vanilla swords sucked 
so that's why I made my own OC sword! Do not steal!" But nah. I just felt like 
I needed some "me" swords. And then decided to share them. Sure they might look
goofy, BUT THEY'RE MY CHILDREN, ALRIGHT? It would make my day if you tried them 
out though. Who knows? I might just make more weapons in this style, one for 
each in the vanilla and do a complete conversion of weaponry!

This package will be shared and updated via Github and will be the main way of 
finding it. This is to avoid redundancy for the viewers. Again, thanks a million 
for simply taking your time to even READ this and if you see anything that's looking 
like a bug or something that could need fixing, please feel free to report them 
on our Discord Server in the proper channel!


Speaking of redundancy, lemme introduce our Discord Channel again! 's great! 
You should really head on over!
